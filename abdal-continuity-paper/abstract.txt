# From Saloi to Abdal: Religious Continuity and Holy Foolishness in Anatolian Conversion to Islam

## Abstract

This paper challenges conventional historiography by proposing that the Anatolian Abdal dervish tradition (Abdalan-i Rum, 13th-15th centuries) represents a significant continuation of Byzantine *saloi* (holy fool) practices through religious conversion, rather than an entirely novel Islamic phenomenon. Drawing on comparative analysis of Byzantine *vitae* and Turkish *menakibname* and *velayetname* hagiographical literature, this study demonstrates striking parallels in antinomian behavior, radical poverty, transgressive performance, and prophetic authority between pre-Islamic Christian holy fools and early Islamic dervish communities in Anatolia. The demographic transformation of Anatolia—from over 90% Christian (6-7 million) in 1000 CE to merely 10% by 1500 CE—suggests mass conversion rather than replacement, while syncretic practices among Bektashi and Abdal communities (veneration of Orthodox saints, incorporation of the Gospel of John, ritual wine use, references to St. Cosmas prophecies) indicate preservation of pre-Islamic spiritual frameworks within new theological vocabularies. Geographic correlation between documented Byzantine *saloi* centers and later *abdal tekkes* further supports this continuity hypothesis.

However, significant methodological limitations warrant acknowledgment: both source traditions are literary constructions compiled generations posthumously, raising questions of historical reliability. Alternative explanations, including convergent evolution of similar ascetic practices and indigenous Shi'i influences (Karakaya-Stump, 2020), merit serious consideration. This analysis risks orientalist essentialism and must avoid conflating literary topoi with lived experience. Nevertheless, by situating Anatolian Islamic mysticism within longer trajectories of regional religious culture, this study contributes to understanding conversion as transformation rather than rupture, challenging rigid periodization between "Byzantine" and "Islamic" Anatolia.

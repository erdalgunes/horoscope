## PART II: SUFI INTOXICATION & ABDALS

### Sufi Concepts: Sukr, Sahw, Fana

**Key Terms:**

**Sukr (سكر):**
- Spiritual intoxication
- Overwhelming absorption in divine reality
- State where mystic loses awareness of world
- Wine metaphor central
- Can be station (maqam) or state (hal) - debated

**Sahw (صحو):**
- Sobriety, clarity
- Return to normal consciousness
- Integration of mystical experience
- "Second sobriety" after intoxication

**Fana (فناء):**
- Annihilation of ego/self
- Dissolution in Divine
- Goal of Sufi path
- Three stages often described:
  1. Fana of deeds (actions absorbed in God's will)
  2. Fana of attributes (qualities lost in God's attributes)
  3. Fana of essence (self disappears in God's essence)

**Baqa (بقاء):**
- Subsistence in God after fana
- Paradox: annihilated yet remaining
- Living from divine reality

**Jadhb / Jazba (جذب):**
- Divine attraction
- Being "pulled" or "drawn" by God
- Can overwhelm normal functioning
- Leads to majdhub state

**Shath (شطح):**
- Ecstatic utterances
- Seemingly blasphemous statements
- Example: Al-Hallaj's "Ana al-Haqq" (I am the Truth/God)
- Caused theological controversy

**Wine Metaphor in Sufi Poetry:**

**Rumi (Jalal al-Din, 1207-1273):**
- Masnavi: extensive wine imagery
- Divan-e Shams: ecstatic love poems
- Wine = divine knowledge and love
- Tavern = khanqah (Sufi lodge)
- Cupbearer = spiritual master
- Intoxication = state of fana

**Hafez (Hafiz, 1315-1390):**
- Master of Persian ghazal
- Wine imagery throughout
- Rind (tavern-goer/libertine) persona
- Critique of formal religion
- Ambiguity: literal vs. metaphorical

**Ibn al-Farid (1181-1235):**
- Arab Sufi poet
- "Khamriyya" (Wine Ode)
- Describes pre-eternal wine
- Drunk before creation

**Theological Debates:**

**Junayd vs. Bayazid:**
- Junayd of Baghdad: sobriety school
- Emphasized sahw, integration
- Cautious about ecstatic claims
- Bayazid Bastami: intoxication school
- Famous for ecstatic utterances
- "Glory be to Me! How great is My Majesty!"

**Is Sukr a Station or State?**
- Station (maqam): permanent achievement
- State (hal): temporary gift
- Most say state, must be transcended
- Second sobriety higher than intoxication

**Orthodox Islamic Critiques:**
- Wine references blasphemous
- Shath statements = kufr (disbelief)
- Leads common people astray
- Al-Hallaj executed (922 CE) for "Ana al-Haqq"

**Sufi Defenses:**
- Metaphorical language
- State beyond reason
- Those in state not responsible
- Hidden meanings for initiates
